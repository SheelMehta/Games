This is a simple web-based Cows and Bulls game. Here, layers try to guess a randomly generated 4-digit number with unique digits. The game provides feedback after each guess using Cows (correct digits in the wrong place) and Bulls (correct digits in the correct place).

Enter a 4-digit number where each digit is unique.
Click "Submit Guess" to check your guess.
The game will respond with:
Bulls → Correct digits in the correct position.
Cows → Correct digits in the wrong position.
Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
When you guess correctly, the game will reset with a new number.
